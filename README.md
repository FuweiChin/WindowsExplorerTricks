# WindowsExplorerTricks
Some Windows Explorer extensions which are mainly collected from [Windows 10 Help Forums](https://www.tenforums.com/).

## Why WindowsExplorerTricks?
To get better operating experience on Windows Explorer, especially for developers who have heavy usage on it and expect more effective/natural experience, I decided to collect some useful tricks, to make them tested, modified and documented for personal use.

## Contents
+ Copy as path
+ Open CMD window here
+ Open WSL window here

## Installation
Generally,
to install a trick, change a trick folder,  
  if there is a file 'install.bat' then run 'install.bat', else run 'add-xxx.reg', 'enable-xxx.reg', 'set-xxx-opt.reg' or something alike.  
to uninstall a trick, change a trick folder,  
  if there is a file 'uninstall.bat' then run 'uninstall.bat', else run 'remove-xxx.reg', 'disable-xxx.reg', 'reset-xxx.reg' or something alike.  

## Usage
*see README of each trick folder*

## Contribution
Since I dont't have time to test tricks for each language, if you have found problems in your language, please submit issues.

### Disclaimer
These tricks come with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRENTY, for personal study only.
